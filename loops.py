# Loops in python

# Using for loop to print out each element in a list

languages = ['English', 'French', 'German', 'Japanese', 'Spanish', 'Italian', 'Chinese']
for language in languages:      #this line tells python to pull a name from the list languages, and associate it with the variable language
    # For every language in languages...
    print(language)
# Any lines of code after the for loop that are not indented are executed once without repetition.
